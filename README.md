### Approach
* Step 1: Initial Training
Train a YOLO model on football players and balls.

* Step 2: Prepare Mixed Player Data
Use a dataset containing basketball, volleyball, and football players without ball annotations.

* Step 3: Freezing Layers
Freeze the layers responsible for detecting footballs and players.
Train the unfrozen layers with mixed player data to generalize across all sports.

* Step 4: Validate
Test on football to confirm detection quality.
Evaluate on basketball and volleyball players for generalization.
